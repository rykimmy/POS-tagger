# POS Tagger
Utilizes Hidden Markov models and Viterbi decoding to tag the parts of speech (POS) of sentences.

## Overview
This project's goal is to build a personal digital assistant (or at least the part of the speech understanding problem that such an assistant would need to handle). The program implements Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach to best tag words with their correct parts of speech using the Viterbi algorithm. The program first goes through training by reading words and their parts of speech, which contributes to the HMM with observations as words and states as tags.

## Execution
To start the program, simply run POS's main function. The text files are used for training and testing purposes. (Note: You can change the text file used for testing in the main function)
